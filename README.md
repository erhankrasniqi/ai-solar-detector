☀️ Artificial Intelligence that detects solar panels from the sky

A small example of how practical AI can turn into real-world business solutions.

Recently, I built an intelligent Python script that uses GPT-5 Vision to analyze aerial images of buildings and automatically detect whether rooftops have solar panels.
And from there… every rooftop becomes your potential customer.

💡 This system is extremely valuable for any kind of business regardless of the industry as it can help to:
🔍 Automatically identify potential clients
📊 Analyze market opportunities through aerial imagery
⚙️ Automate reporting and sales processes

🧠 How it works:

Reads the address list

Analyzes aerial images using GPT-5 Vision

Generates structured results

Automatically updates the data and creates labeled images

It doesn’t matter what type of business you manage — implementing AI Automation is an excellent way to streamline customer discovery and analysis.

🧩 I’m also sharing a small part of the script that demonstrates how GPT-5 Vision analyzes images and returns structured JSON results.
